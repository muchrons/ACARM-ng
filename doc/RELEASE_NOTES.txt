* alerts dropped by the preprocessor are no longer saved in data base.
* added workaround for missing GNU C macros when using Intel's compiler.
* added support for toolchain selection in configure script (intel and gcc).
* new preprocessor's features:
  - less-than comparison
  - greater-than comparison
  - all relations (<,>,==) now support automatic numbers parsing to compare them as numbers, not as strings.
  - rule output formatters allowing to pre-process data from given field(s), before running comparison.
* added more tests for external libraries, required for compilation.

* added command line arguments, like automatic daemonizing, dropping privileges, etc...
* config file inclusion added.
* data base creation scripts are now automatically installed when 'make install' is run.
* added pseudo-collection of all leafs to meta-alert's tree element, when accessed with string facade.
* added severity and certainty as a meta-alert's tree element, when accessed with string facade.
* algorithms dedicated for use in C++ are now more robust:
  - const and non-const versions are supported.
  - smart and raw pointers are supported as arguments.
* comparisons with regular expressions in preprocessor rules.
* support for SnortSam firewall reconfiguration tool (as a trigger).
* fixed compatibility issue with postgres 9.1 and previous releases.
* fixed condition for warning on data abse cleanup taking too long.
* added preprocessors for triggers.
* added heartbeats for external service (dshiled), when using ipblacklist filter.
* unified string-access between preprocessor and Python API - the same syntax is used now (except for the collections).
* Python interface for writing filters has been created.


-- v0.3.3 --
* fixed timezone in WUI, when DB server is not configured in UTC.


-- v0.3.2 --
* fixed "path too long" bug in string-access facade.


-- v0.3.1 --

* fixed compilation with icc (intel toolchain) on hosts with machine-dependent includes in /usr/include/<machine> implicit directory.


-- v0.3.x --
* Python interface for writing triggers has been created.
* added support for Python scripts (via Persistency::Facades::StrAccess and PythonAPI interfaces).
* Prado 3.1.9 introduced for WUI.
* added tests to configure script - now each requirement is tested, before delivery.
* clean-up in project's root directory.
* added heartbeats visualization to WUI.
* added logs of all actions in WUI (browsable via WUI).


-- v0.2.1 --

* documentation updates.
* simplified autotools-like compile and installation wrapper.
* new version of build process.
* added dedicated thread for signals handling (ensures no dead locks are possible when sending signals).
* main branch is now publicly available.
* filters:
  - new event
  - users monitor
  - content similarity
* icc support (intel toolchain).
